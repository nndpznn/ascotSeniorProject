Project: Schedulr
=========================
Proposal Document [2 points]:
   Verbal Description:
      Your proposal successfully explains that you are continuing
         development of Ascot Microforest Connect, which consists of
         three major components.  The semester's focus includes
         modernization and scaling for multiple microforests.  This is
         a strong and clear high-level description.
      Your proposal describes three main components, and the information
         is embedded in paragraphs.  You describe the software stack and
         the development tools which satisfies the requirement.
      You clearly identify authorized contributors (e.g., microforest
         volunteers, students, scientists) and casual observers who want
         to learn about microforests.  This satisfies the requirement.


   Justification:
      You reference experience with Web development, Multi-app structures,
         Database work (Firebase), and Code modernization which meets the
         requirement well.  Further, you express that the Firebase structure
         will be more complex than anything you've handled, Multi-platform
         (mobile + admin + public portal) development is new to you, and
         that modernization/scaling introduce new challenges.  This clearly
         demonstrates extension.
      You explicitly state that the project requires you to work at your
         best with complexity is higher than anything you’ve done before,
         but you feel it is manageable and already partly implemented.
         This satisfies the "not too easy, not too hard" expectation.
      Finally you say that the project was already in progress when you
         took it over, but that you believe you can complete key
         functionality and will focus first on database restructuring and
         modernization, which demonstrates feasibility.


Proposal Presentation [Slides and video] [3 points]:
   Slides:
      This is a great presentation with wonderful graphics that illustrate
      the topic well.  Your slides are well-organized and have the right
      amount of text to provide the 'hooks' the audience needs without the
      distractions of long paragraphs of dense text.  Very well done.
